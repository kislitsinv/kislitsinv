### Hi there!
I'm Vladimir, for the colleagues and friends from different places than Russia & CIS I'm Bob ;)

I am originally from Kazakhstan :kazakhstan:, but I managed to work in a number of countries

:ru: :belarus: :vietnam: :united_arab_emirates: :us:

* I do IT stuff since 2009 - then I used to work with HTML/CSS/JS :baby_symbol:
* Then I went to PHP and deeper JS (but jquery is still a magic :sparkles: :joy:)
* Started JAVA in 2017 :underage:
* Since then took some break on coding and began to manage IT teams :office_worker:
* Now i do Java (mainly), PHP, JS (Angular 2, Vue) and managing IT-teams)

*git/ansible/artifactory/jenkins/zabbix and many more other interesting stuff*
